# Images-Identification-using-PyTorch


This is the model that identifies flower species from images using PyTorch
You can build a deep learning network to identify many different types of flowers(Check the datasets in the directory). ... As I was creating deep learning models with PyTorch.
score your trained model based on its accuracy on classifying flower species.

Classify the images!!!!
